Project Overview:
This project is a front-end Discord clone that replicates the layout and design of Discord, a popular communication platform, using HTML for the structure and Tailwind CSS for styling.
The app focuses on the user interface, with interactive elements like the sidebar, message area, and channel navigation. While the project doesn't implement real-time chat or a backend, 
it offers a responsive and aesthetically similar experience to Discord's design.
